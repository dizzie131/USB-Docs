When using Sonarr, occasionally you may download a torrent file that contains multiple .rar / r.01 / r.02 files.
This guide assumes you are using the Media Management feature of Sonarr, and will show you how to extract the files using SSH so Sonarr can complete the post processing.

1.  Connect to your seedbox via [SSH](https://docs.usbx.me/books/secure-shell-%28ssh%29/page/how-to-connect-to-your-seedbox-via-ssh)
2.  Navigate to the path of the torrent folder using the `cd` command (eg `cd ~/files/NameOfTorrentFolder`). Tip: Use your favorite FTP client to easily locate the path to the folder.
3.  Run the following command to begin the extraction process ```unrar x FILENAME.rar```

Once the extraction has been completed, the extracted file will be in the folder, ready for Sonarr to complete the post processing.
